- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/) - CSS library


### What I learned

I learned how to make the configuration so it deploy in ghpages.
Learned a buit of the basics of react, much more about tailwind and the configuration, the same with vite
The use of order with grid in tailwind
Work more fluidly with components and the understanding on how they work.


### Continued development

I need to continue practicing react, i mean learn it first and make bigger and interesting projects
